        <p>The Human Centipede (First Sequence) is a 2009 Dutch independent body horror film written, directed and co-produced by Tom Six. The film concerns a deranged German surgeon who kidnaps three tourists and conjoins them surgically, mouth to anus, forming the eponymous "human centipede". It stars Dieter Laser as Josef Heiter, the creator of the centipede; and Ashley C. Williams, Ashlynn Yennie, and Akihiro Kitamura as Heiter's victims.</p>

            <p>The movie is a beautiful masterpiece in filmmaking like a butterfly coming out of its cocoon, it (the human centipede) touched my heart with its beautiful messages and execution. I would recommend this to everyone 3 years old and older. You can teach your young kids the beauty of the human mind and older people will learn the beautiful ideas running through young filmmakers' minds. (The human centipede) shifted my soul in a way I never thought any movie could. My 6-year-old sister was crying in pride that her brother let her see it she was screaming her vocal cords out because she just loved the ending. I couldn't stop watching. Beautiful</p>
